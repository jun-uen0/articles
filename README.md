Also, working on building a tech blog.

## Creation rules
Because I'm blogging with a full-scratched app with this repo with sensitive path logic, I have to follow with rules below.  
① English contents - {project_name}_en.md  
② Japanese contents - {project_name}_jp.md  
③ If the content's dir has images, make 'img' dir and contain them in it.
