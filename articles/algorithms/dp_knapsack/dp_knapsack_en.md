# Dynamic Programming: 0/1 Knapsack Problem (1D & 2D DP)

## Problem
Given a list of weights and values and a total capacity, determine the maximum value that can be placed in the knapsack.

## 2D DP
```python
def knapsack_2d(weights, values, W):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (W + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(W + 1):
            if weights[i - 1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]
    return dp[n][W]
```

## 1D DP (space optimized)
```python
def knapsack_1d(weights, values, W):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [0] * (W + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        for w in range(W, weights[i] - 1, -1):
            dp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - weights[i]] + values[i])
    return dp[W]
```
