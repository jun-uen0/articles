# Dynamic Programming: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## Problem
Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

## Tabulation Approach (2D DP)
```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return dp[m][n]
```
